# Changelog

## 0.8.5 (not released)
* Fixed add_provider_to_user with CamelCased authentications_class model (#382)
* Fixed unlock_token_mailer_disabled to only disable automatic mailing (#467)
* Make send_email_* methods easier to overwrite (#473)
* Don't add `:username` field for User. Config option `username_attribute_names` is now `:email` by default instead of `:username`.

  If you're using `username` as main field for users to login, you'll need to tune your Sorcery config:

    ```ruby
    config.user_config do |user|
      # ...
      user.username_attribute_names = [:username]
    end
    ```
* `rails generate sorcery:install` now works inside Rails engine

## 0.8.4

  * Few security fixes in `external` module

## 0.8.3 (yanked because of bad Jeweler release)

## 0.8.2

* Activity logging feature has a new column called `last_login_from_ip_address` (string type). If you use ActiveRecord, you will have to add this column to DB ([#465](https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery/issues/465))

## 0.6.0

Fixes issues with external user_hash not including some fields, and an issue with User model not loaded when user_class is called. Now config.user_class should be a string or a symbol.

Improved specs.

## 0.5.3

Fixed #9
Fixed hardcoded method names in remember_me submodule.
Improved specs.

## 0.5.21

Fixed typo in initializer - MUST be "config.user_class = User"

## 0.5.2

Fixed #3 and #4 - Modular Sinatra apps work now, and User model isn't cached in development mode.

## 0.5.1

Fixed bug in reset_password - after reset can't login due to bad salt creation. Affected only Mongoid.

## 0.5.0

Added support for Mongoid! (still buggy and not recommended for serious use)

'reset_password!(:password => new_password)' changed into 'change_password!(new_password)'

## 0.4.2

Added test helpers for Rails 3 & Sinatra.

## 0.4.1

Fixing Rails app name in initializer.

## 0.4.0

Changed the way Sorcery is configured.
Now inside the model only add:

```
authenticates_with_sorcery!
```

In the controller no code is needed! All configuration is done in an initializer.
Added a rake task to create it.

```
rake sorcery:bootstrap
```

## 0.3.1

Renamed "oauth" module to "external" and made API prettier.
```
auth_at_provider(provider) => login_at(provider)
login_from_access_token(provider) => login_from(provider)
create_from_provider!(provider) => create_from(provider)
```

## 0.3.0

Added Sinatra support!
